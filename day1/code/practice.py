    OUTPUT: tuple of two ints/floats

    Given a list of ints and/or floats, return a 2-tuple containing the values

    INPUT: list
    OUTPUT: bool

    Given a list of strings, return whether ALL of the elements are
    palindromes.

    Hint: add an import statement at the top so you can use the is_palindrome
    function.
