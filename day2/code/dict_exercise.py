def dict_to_str(d):
    '''
    INPUT: dict
    OUTPUT: str

    Return a str containing each key and value in dict d. Keys and values are
    separated by a comma and a space. Each key-value pair is separated by a new
    line.

    For example:
    a: 1
    b: 2

    For nice pythonic code, use iteritems!

    Note: it's possible to do this in 1 line using list comprehensions and the
    join method.

    pass


def dict_to_str_sorted(d):
    '''
    INPUT: dict
    OUTPUT: str

    Return a str containing each key and value in dict d. Keys and values are
    separated by a space. Each key-value pair is separated by a comma, and the
    pairs are sorted in ascending order by key.

    Note: This one is also doable in one line!
    '''
    pass


def dict_difference(d1, d2):
    '''
    INPUT: dict, dict
    OUTPUT: dict

    Return a dictionary containing keys that are in both dictionaries. The
    values should be the absolute value of the difference between the two
    values from the dictionaries. If a value is only in one dictionary, the
    value should be the absolute value of that value.
